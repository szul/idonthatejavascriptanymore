    "# New Number Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Math has always been a little difficult to maneuver in JavaScript because of the flexibility of variable types. I remember having difficulty in the early 2000's with the way 8 and 10 were handled while doing comparisons. In particular, they were being compared as string despite being numbers, and this comparison was tripping only on 8 and 10. In order to solve for it, I had to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "parseInt(8, 10);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "parseInt(10, 10);\n",
    "```\n",

    "...forcing the radix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't mean that you can't do powerful math in JavaScript. In fact, a few upcoming notebooks will show just how powerful JavaScript can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "But luckily, JavaScript's management of numbers has improved over the years as well, and we'll look at a few additional methods here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Not a number\n",
    "\n",
    "Most are familiar with `NaN` and the `isNaN()` global function. In modern JavaScript, we now have `Number.isNaN()` to correct some of the past issues with `isNaN()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "From MDN:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Due to both equality operators, `==` and `===`, evaluating to `false` when checking if `NaN` is `NaN`, the function `Number.isNaN()` has become necessary. This situation is unlike all other possible value comparisons in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In comparison to the global `isNaN()` function, `Number.isNaN()` doesn't suffer the problem of forcefully converting the parameter to a number. This means it is now safe to pass values that would normally convert to `NaN`, but aren't actually the same value as `NaN`. This also means that only values of the type `number`, that are also `NaN`, return `true`."
